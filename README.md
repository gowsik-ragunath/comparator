# Comparator

A CSV file comparator which will returns a hash which contains column name as key with a list of missing data as value after comparing both csv files

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'comparator'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install comparator

## Usage

```
require "comparator"
```

Now, create an instance for Comparator as

```
comparator = Comparator::CompareCSV.new(to_be_compared_file_path, compared_with_file_path)
```

`to_be_compared_file_path` - first argument should be a file path to get miss match of data comparing with the other csv file.

`compared_with_file_path` - second argument should be a file path of other csv file which will be compared.


**Note: Both file should follow same header names and column data order**

```
Example Format file1.csv:
   Column1,Column2
   a,1
   b,2
   
Example Format file2.csv:
   Column1,Column2
   c,1
   b,50
   
comparator = Comparator::CompareCSV.new(file1.csv, file2.csv)
puts comparator.csv_file_comparator
# {"Column1"=>["a"],"Column2"=>["2"]}
```
